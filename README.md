# Weather App

### Live Page: https://weather-app-react-commandshift.netlify.app/

This is a weather app that allows users to search for the current weather and forecast of a city.

This was one of the first apps I built using React and helped me learn about props, state, snapshot & component testing.

## Features

### Search for a City

Currently you can get the current location weather details for any city in the world, however the forecast will only work for cities in the UK. This fun little ~~bug~~ feature is due to the current location using the OpenWeather API to make requests whereas the forecast makes an API request to a custom backend server.

### Future Features

- [ ] Dark & Light Mode
- [ ] Sunrise and Sunset Images
- [ ] BG changes depending on time of day
- [x] Location component icons
- [ ] Switch completely to openWeather API
- [ ] Switch Production branch from main -> Production
- [x] Remove ESlint console no rule

## Development

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

The app also uses the axios library to make API requests to the [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/api) and the moment library to format the date and time.

## Installation

To install the app, clone the repository to your local machine and run npm install to install the necessary dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/tsv-stacks/react-weather-app
cd react-weather-app
npm install
```

To use this app, you will need to create your own `.env` file with your OpenWeather API key. You can get your own API key by signing up for a free account on the [OpenWeather website](https://openweathermap.org/api).

After signing up, create a `.env` file in the root of the project and add the following line, replacing {YOUR_API_KEY} with your actual API key:

```
REACT_APP_API_KEY={YOUR_API_KEY}
```

Make sure to restart the development server after making changes to the `.env` file.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

The application uses [Jest](https://jestjs.io/) as its testing framework.
